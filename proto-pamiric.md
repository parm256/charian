# Phonology
Proto-Pamiric has a fairly typical phonology for a satem language.

| **Consonants** | _Labial_ | _Coronal_ | _Palatal_ | _Dorsal_ |
| :------------  | :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :----: |
| _Nasal_ | *m | *n |
| _Plosives (unaspirated)_ | *p *b | *t *d | *c *j | *k *g |
| _Plosives (aspirated)_[^vasp] | *p<sup>h</sup> *b<sup>h</sup> | *t<sup>h</sup> *d<sup>h</sup> | *c<sup>h</sup> *j<sup>h</sup> | *k<sup>h</sup> *g<sup>h</sup> |
| _Fricatives_ | | *s *z | *š *ž | *ḫ *ḥ[^h-lars] |
| _Liquids_ | *w | *r *l | *y | (*w) |

| **Vowels** | _Front_ | _Back_ |
| :- | :-: | :-: |
| _High_ | *i *ī | *u *ū |
| _Low_ | *e *ē | *a *ā |

[^vasp]: Likely pronounced longer than unaspirated counterparts since they are reflected as geminates in descendant languages.
[^h-lars]: _\*ḥ_, from PIE _\*h<sub>1</sub>_, has no direct reflexes in descendant languages, but was likely pronounced as \[ɦ\]. On the other hand, _\*ḫ_, from PIE _\*h<sub>2</sub>_ and _\*h<sub>3</sub>_, is preserved word-initially in descendant languages.
