# Phonology
Proto-Charian has a fairly typical phonology for a satem language. Many of the changes are similar to Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic, especially satemization, RUKIs, collapse of the PIE _\*o_ _\*a_ distinction, and

[^vasp]: Likely pronounced longer than unaspirated counterparts since they are reflected as geminates in descendant languages.
[^h-lars]: _\*ḥ_, from PIE _\*h<sub>1</sub>_, has no direct reflexes in descendant languages, but was likely pronounced as \[ɦ\]. On the other hand, _\*ḫ_, from PIE _\*h<sub>2</sub>_ and _\*h<sub>3</sub>_, is preserved word-initially in descendant languages as \[χ\].
[^pals]: Likely pronounced as palatovelar sibilants and affricates rather than plain palatal plosives and non-sibilant fricatives.


## Sound Changes

### Correspondences

### Changes in Common IE
The period of IE before the disintegration of the dialect continuum into distinct languages is known as Common IE. During this era, PIE underwent major sound changes, such as the various IE sound laws, and grammatical remodeling, such as the emergence of the feminine gender or simplification of nominal ablaut.

One of the first changes within Common IE was the coloring of _*e_ by _*h<sub>2</sub>_ _*h<sub>3</sub>_ into _*a_ _*o_. This change is so archaic that it can be observed even in the Anatolian branch, which split even before the Common IE period. It operated as a surface filter until Proto-Charian.

* \*e > \*a / \_h<sub>2</sub> / h<sub>2</sub>\_ (e.g. _*h<sub>2</sub>éǵros_ > _*h<sub>2</sub>áǵros_ > _*ḫájras_)
* \*e > \*o / \_h<sub>3</sub> / h<sub>3</sub>\_ (e.g. _*déh<sub>3</sub>nom_ > _*dóh<sub>3</sub>nom_ > _*dúḫnan_)

Laryngeals were deleted on a large scale through Pinault's Law and the Saussure effect. This is evident in the inflectional paradigms of affected words.

* \*H > \*∅ / VR\_y (e.g. _*h<sub>2</sub>árh<sub>3</sub>yeti_ > _*h<sub>2</sub>áryeti_ > _*ḫáryeti_)
* \*H > \*∅ / oR\_C (e.g. _*tórh<sub>1</sub>mos_ > _*tórmos_ > _*túrmas_)

Sieb’s Law created the series of voiceless aspirates. While the paucity of such forms makes it hard to determine, it is likely that it not only affected s-mobile roots, but all cases of initial _*s_.

* \*B<sup>h</sup> > \*P<sup>h</sup> / #s\_ (e.g. _*sg<sup>h</sup>rénd<sup>h</sup>is_ > _*sk<sup>h</sup>rénd<sup>h</sup>is_ > _*sk<sup>h</sup>rínd<sup>h</sup>iš_)

Consonant clusters also underwent changes. Obstruent clusters regressively assimilated in voice. Aspirated plosives lost their aspiration if followed by an unaspirated plosive. If there were multiple aspirates in the same cluster, the whole cluster would become aspirated. Dental clusters ejected a _\*s_ between the elements, which was later reduced.

* \*P \*s > \*B \*z / \_B (e.g. _*nisdós_ > _*nizdós_ > _*niždás_)
* \*B > \*P / \_{P, s} (e.g. _*bʰah<sub>2</sub>gtós_ > _*bʰah<sub>2</sub>któs_ > _*bʰaḫktás_)
* \*C<sup>h</sup>C<sup>h</sup> > \*CC<sup>h</sup> (e.g. _*d<sup>h</sup>ǵ<sup>h</sup>yés_ > _\*dǵ<sup>h</sup>yés_ > _\*dj<sup>h</sup>yíš_)
* \*P<sup>h</sup> \*B<sup>h</sup> > \*P \*B / \_{P, B} (e.g. _*b<sup>h</sup>ut<sup>h</sup>tós_ > _*b<sup>h</sup>uttós_ > _*b<sup>h</sup>ut<sup>s</sup>tás_)
* \*tt<sup>(h)</sup> \*dd<sup>(h)</sup> > \*t<sup>s</sup>t<sup>(h)</sup> \*d<sup>z</sup>d<sup>(h)</sup> (e.g. _\*wittós_ > _*wit<sup>s</sup>tós_ > _*wit<sup>s</sup>tás_)

Stang's and Szeremenyi's Laws were both early laws that also affected inflectional paradigms. Szeremenyi's Law became analogized to all consonant-stem nouns; even ones that did not lose any consonants gained a long vowel in the nominative singular. Similarly, lost consonants were analogized back in a few cases.

* \*Vwm > \*V:m / \_# (e.g. _*g<sup>w</sup>ówm_ > _*g<sup>w</sup>ṓm_ > _*gā́n_)

The _boukolos_ rule was another early surface filter that prompted the loss of the labial quality of labiovelars when before or after _*u_ _*w_. However, the labiovelars would have lost their labial quality due to later satemization, but we still posit that the _boukolos_ rule was productive because it was present in most, if not all, other branches.

* \*K<sup>w</sup> > \*K / {u, w}\_ / \_{u, w} (e.g. _*éwewk<sup>w</sup>et_ > _*éwewket_ > _*íweuket_)

The Common IE phase for Charian lasts roughly from 3500 BCE to 2900 BCE, give or take a few centuries. The changes that occurred during this time applied in some way or another to most of IE, save for Anatolian and Tocharian.

### Syllabic resonants and vowel shifts
The handling of syllabic resonants seems to be the change that first really separated Charian from the rest of IE. Syllabic resonants interacted with surrounding consonants, vowels, and especially laryngeals in a complex fashion like Greek. The various syllabic resonants ejected a schwa in a position determined by the surrounding environment.

* \*HṚ > \*HəR (e.g. _\*h<sub>2</sub>ṃbʰí_ > _\*h<sub>2</sub>əmbʰí_ > _*ḫamb<sup>h</sup>í_)
* \*ṚH > \*RəH (e.g. _*pḷh<sub>1</sub>nós_ > _*pləh<sub>1</sub>nós_ > _*pleḥnás_)
* \*Ṇ > \*əN (e.g. _*septṃ́_ > _*septə́m_ > _*septán_)
* \*Ṛ > \*Rə / C\_{R, CC} (e.g. _*dṛ́ḱtis_ > _*drə́ḱtis_ > _*dríctiš_)
* \*Ṛ > \*əR (e.g. _*mṛtós_ > _*mərtós_ > _*murtás_)

This schwa was quickly lost due to various coloring process. The schwa is first colored by any surrounding laryngeals. Afterwards, any remaining schwa is colored by any surrounding labialized or palatal consonants. Finally, any uncolored schwa becomes _*a_.

* \*ə > \*u / {m, w, Kʷ}\_ / \_{m, w, Kʷ} (e.g. _*wə́rmis_ > _*wúrmis_ > _*wúrmiš_)
* \*ə > \*i / {i, y}...\_ / \_...{i, y} (e.g. _*ḱrədyóm_ > _*ḱridyóm_ > _*cridyán_)
* \*ə > \*a (e.g. _*ḱəmtóm_ > _*ḱamtóm_ > _*cantán_)

Another vowel change was the process of tonic raising, where _*é_ _*ó_ raised to _*í_ _*ú_ in certain environments. However, this change was notoriously inconsistent, with tons of dialectal and local variations in its operation. For example, High Charian _méddu_, _jánu_, and _dáru_ are attested in place of expected _**míddu_, _**júnu_, and _**dúru_. High Charian also likely prevented it in some final syllables, due to _-ás_ being continued from _*-ós_, instead of _**-úš_.

* \*é \*ó > \*í \*ú !/ \_{y, w} (e.g. _*móri_ > _*múri_ > _*múri_)

Overall, the change shows that the development of Charian was far from uniform and had many variations within. The inconsistency of the reflexes in High Charian is likely due to its origin as a semi-formalized vernacular dialect which happened to adopt some variants over others.

### Consonant adjustments and satemization
The nasal consonants are assimilated to the following consonant sounds. _*n_ likely had allophones for other places of articulation.

* \*n > \*m / \_{P, B}[+labial] (e.g. _*anb<sup>h</sup>it<sup>s</sup>tós_ > _*amb<sup>h</sup>it<sup>s</sup>tós_ > _*amb<sup>h</sup>it<sup>s</sup>tás_)
* \*m > \*n / \_{s, T, K, Ḱ, K<sup>w</sup>, #} (e.g. _*gumtós_ > _*guntós_ > _*guntás_)

Much like in Greek and Sanskrit, Grassmann's Law operated as a surface filter that caused aspirates to lose their aspiration when another aspirate was present in the word, causing consonant alternation in roots that have aspirates in them.

* \*C<sup>h</sup>…C<sup>h</sup> > \*C…C<sup>h</sup> (e.g. _*bʰéwdʰeti_ > _*béwd<sup>h</sup>eti_ > _*béud<sup>h</sup>eti_)

Also, there were environments

* \*l > \*r / T_ (e.g. _*putlós_ > _*putrós_ > _*putrás_)

Charian holds satemization in common with Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic, Armenian, and Albanian on some accounts. Three changes happened over a similar timeframe: the merger of labiovelars with back velars, the merger of _*h<sub>2</sub>_ with _*h<sub>3</sub>_, and the merger of _*a_ with _*o_. Balto-Slavic, Armenian, and Indo-Iranian merged _*a_ with _*o_, but Armenian does not and Germanic, a centum branch, does.

* \*K<sup>w</sup> > \*K (e.g. _*k<sup>w</sup>ík<sup>w</sup>los_ > _*kíklos_ > _*kíklas_)
* \*o > \*a (e.g. _*h<sub>1</sub>ícwos_ > _*h<sub>1</sub>ícwas_ > _*ḥícwas_)

Similarly, the merger of laryngeals is attested in Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic where the laryngeals have no different reflexes beyond vowel coloring. However, Armenian seemingly merges _*h<sub>2</sub>_ with _*h<sub>3</sub>_, which is reflected as an initial _h_, while _*h<sub>1</sub>_ is completely lost, according to Martirosyan, which is similar to Charian.

* \*h<sub>3</sub> > \*h<sub>2</sub> (e.g. _*píbh<sub>3</sub>ati_ > _*píbh<sub>2</sub>ati_ > _*píbḫati_)

Other palatalizing changes occurred during this time. Satemization was likely a chain shift of back velars becoming regular velars, labiovelars losing their labialization, and the front velars becoming palatalized. The _RUKIs_ rule also operated in Charian, which retracts _*s_ when after velars, high vowels, semivowels, and _*r_. Notably, as in Sanskrit, _RUKIs_ was blocked in the case of _*sr_.

* \*ḱ<sup>(h)</sup> \*ǵ<sup>(h)</sup> > \*c<sup>(h)</sup> \*j<sup>(h)</sup> (e.g. _*yaǵnás_ > _*yajnás_ > _*yajnás_)
* \*S > \*Š / {r, U, K, I}\_ !/ \_r (e.g. _*h<sub>2</sub>áwsās_ > _*h<sub>2</sub>áwšās_ > _*ḫáušās_)

Exceptionally, thorn clusters were not originally lenited or metathesized, much like Sanskrit. Rather, they were continued into Proto-Charian as dental-palatal clusters. In High Charian, they shifted into velar-palatal clusters where the palatal element lenited into its corresponding fricative, e.g. _*tḱitós_ > _*tcitás_ > _kšitás_. Parallels can be found with labial-palatal clusters, cf. _*pḱuwénts_ > _*pcuwénts_ > _pšuvénts_.

* \*K > \*J / {P, T}\_ (e.g. _*dg<sup>h</sup>ítiš_ > _*dj<sup>h</sup>ítiš_ > _*dj<sup>h</sup>ítiš_)

### Final changes
Vowel-semivowel clusters coalesce into diphthongs

* \*Vw > \*Vu !/ \_V (e.g. _*leláyket_ > _*leláiket_ > _*leláiket_)

Also, _*h<sub>1</sub>_ _*h<sub>2</sub>_ are written as _*ḥ_ _*ḫ_.

### one

The term for ‘one’ in Proto-Charian was likely _*áiwas_, declined as a thematic adjective, yielding High Charian _ḗvas_. Notably, it carried on PIE _*Hóywos_, like Greek _οἶος_ or Avestan _aēva_, instead of from more common _*Hóynos_, (cf. Latin _ūnus_, Greek _οἴνη_, Celtic _*oinos_, Germanic _*ainaz_) or from _*Hóykos_ (cf. Sanskrit _éka_). The lack of a laryngeal in the later form suggests that the PIE form could have been _\*\*h<sub>1</sub>óywos_, yielding _\*\*ḥáiwas_.

The combining form of ‘one’ was _*sam-_ from PIE _*sṃ-_, yielding _sam-_, cognate with Latin _sem-_, Greek _ἁ-_ and _εἷς_, and Sanskrit _sa-_.

The ordinal ‘first’ was _*prawás_ from PIE _*pro-wós_, yielding _*právas_, declined as a thematic adjective. Greek _πρῶτος_, Latin _prīmus_, and Sanskrit _prathamá_ are likely related in some way, but from different formations. The term was derived from the preposition _*pro_, reflected as _*pra-_ ~ _*prú_ in Charian, which has the meaning of 'forwards', suggesting that the ordinal shifted from the meaning of 'foremost' to simply 'first'.

### two
The term for ‘two’ in Proto-Charian was _*dwáḥ_ from PIE _*dwóh<sub>1</sub>_, yielding High Charian _dvā́_. Predictably, the term was declined as a thematic adjective, but only in the dual. The term is cognate with Latin _duo_, Greek _δύο_, Sanskrit _dvá_, and English _two_. Notably, it did not carry on _*dúwoh<sub>1</sub>_ as Greek did.

The combining form was _*dwi-_, yielding _*dvi-_, cognate with Latin _bi-_, Greek _δι-_, and Sanskrit _dvi-_.

The ordinal 'second' was _*dwitás_ from PIE _*dwi-tós_, yielding _*dvitás_. Another term _*ḫánteras_, from PIE _*h<sub>2</sub>énteros_ was used specifically to mention the second out of two, rather than the second out of many.

### three
The term for 'three' in Proto-Charian was _*tríyes_ from PIE _*tréyes_, yielding High Charian _*trîš_, which declined as an i-stem. The term is cognate with Latin _trēs_, Greek _τρεῖς_, Sanskrit _tráya_, and English _three_.

The combining form was _*tri-_, cognate with Latin _tri-_, Greek _τρι-_, and Sanskrit _tri-_.

The ordinal form was _*tritás_, from PIE _*tritós_, yielding _tritás_.

### four
The term for 'four' in Proto-Charian was _*ketwúres_ from PIE _*k<sup>w</sup>etwóres_, yielding High Charian _*ketū́res_, which declined as a consonant stem. The term is cognate with Latin _quattuor_, Greek _

The combining form was _*_
